## Objectives

### 1. Data Analysis with SQL

#### Data Cleaning and Manipulation

- Imported and cleaned the Northwind Trade dataset in SQL Server to ensure data accuracy and completeness.

#### Data Exploration

- Executed complex SQL queries to extract key metrics and perform exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Sales trends
  - Customer segmentation
  - Product performance
  - Logistic/Shipping analysis

#### Advanced Analysis

- Applied advanced SQL techniques such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs) to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

---

### 2. Python for Traders' Analysis

#### Data Import and Cleaning

- Loaded the dataset into Python using pandas for additional analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted EDA to understand data distributions and relationships.

#### Statistical Analysis

- Performed statistical analyses to identify significant patterns and trends.

---

### 3. Visualization with Power BI

#### Data Import

- Imported the results of SQL queries and Python analyses into Power BI for visualization.

#### Dashboard Creation

- Designed interactive dashboards and reports to visualize:
  - Sales performance
  - Customer demographics
  - Product popularity
  - Logistic metrics

#### Insights Visualization

- Created visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in sales and customer behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the **Northwind Trade Dataset**, a classic sample database provided by Microsoft, originally designed to demonstrate database operations like querying, reporting, and data analysis. It simulates the operations of a fictional company called "Northwind Traders," which imports and exports specialty foods globally. You can access and download the dataset from the following link:

- [Northwind Traders Dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs)

---

## Tools and Libraries

- **SQL:** Used for data extraction, cleaning, and advanced analysis.
- **Python:** Utilized for traders' analysis with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Power BI:** Employed for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing insights.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis and visualizations, follow these steps:

1. **Download the dataset** from [Northwind Traders Dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs).

2. **Set up your environment**:
   - Install SQL Server or any SQL-based database system.
   - Install Python and the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
     ```
   - Set up Power BI Desktop for creating visualizations.

3. **Load the dataset into SQL Server** and execute the provided SQL scripts to perform data analysis.

4. **Conduct Python analysis** by running the provided Python scripts for traders' analysis.

5. **Import the results into Power BI** for visualization.

6. **Explore the dashboards** in Power BI to view insights.
