# Comprehensive Data Analysis: Data Analysis on Northwind Trade Dataset with SQL/Python and Visualizing with Power BI

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of the Northwind Trade dataset using SQL for data manipulation, Python for traders' analysis, and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to uncover insights into trade and sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends through detailed SQL queries, Python analysis, and interactive Power BI dashboards.

## Objectives

### 1. Data Analysis with SQL:
#### Data Cleaning and Manipulation:
- Imported and cleaned the Northwind Trade dataset in SQL Server to ensure data accuracy and completeness.

#### Data Exploration:
- Executed complex SQL queries to extract key metrics and perform exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Sales trends
  - Product performance
  - Logistic/Shipping

#### Advanced Analysis:
- Implemented advanced SQL techniques such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs) to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

---

### 2. Python for Traders' Analysis:
#### Key Metrics:
- Performed detailed analysis of traders' performance using Python.
- Explored traders' revenue contributions, efficiency, and regional impact.
- Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for advanced data manipulation and visualization.

#### Visualization:
- Created data-driven insights with Python to identify:
  - High-performing traders
  - Revenue trends by trader and region
  - Patterns in trader contributions to product sales

### 3. Visualization with Power BI:
#### Data Import:
- Imported the results of SQL queries into Power BI for visualization.

#### Dashboard Creation:
- Designed interactive dashboards and reports to visualize:
  - Sales performance
  - Product popularity
  - Logistic and shipping analysis

#### Insights Visualization:
- Created visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in sales, products and logistic process.
